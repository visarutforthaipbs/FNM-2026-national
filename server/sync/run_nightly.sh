# Nightly DIW sync for Factory Near Me, running on lsev01 against the
# self-hosted Supabase. Pushes regenerated static data to GitHub.
#
# It does NOT reach the public site. Vercel is not connected to the repository —
# a deploy is triggered by hand (`vercel --prod` from client/, or the Vercel
# dashboard), deliberately, so a human gates what reaches production. Until
# someone does that, this script's output is committed and waiting, not live.
#
# Safety: HANDOFF.md documents a run that silently halved factories.status.
# This script snapshots the operating-factory count before and after and
# REFUSES to publish if it drops more than 5%.
#
# The pipeline's delete-then-insert steps (permits, factory_statistics) are
# guarded as of 2026-08-08: they no-op in test mode, and permits refuses to
# clear on an implausibly small fetch. The 5% guard below is a second layer —
# note it only blocks PUBLISHING bad exports, it cannot undo a bad DB write.
